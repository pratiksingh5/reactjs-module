ES6 is a set of features that were introduced in ECMAScript 2015. These features include arrow functions, template literals, destructuring assignment, and more.

Here are some of the key features of ES6:
- Arrow functions: Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions. They are defined using the `=>` operator.
- Template literals: Template literals allow you to embed expressions inside strings. They are enclosed in backticks (`) and can be used to create multi-line strings.
- Destructuring assignment: Destructuring assignment allows you to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables. It is done using the `=` operator.
- Spread operator: The spread operator allows you to expand an array or an object into individual elements. It is used to pass multiple arguments to a function.
- Classes: Classes provide a way to define objects with properties and methods. They are defined using the `class` keyword.
- Modules: Modules allow you to split your code into separate files and import/export functionality between them. They are defined using the `import` and `export` keywords.  
- Promises: Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are used to represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
- Generators: Generators allow you to define functions that can be paused and resumed. They are defined using the `function*` keyword.
- Maps and Sets: Maps and Sets are data structures that allow you to store key-value pairs. They are defined using the `Map` and `Set` constructors.
