1. What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of setState()?

ðŸ§  The core reason: React state updates are asynchronous and batched

React doesn't immediately update the state after you call setState() â€” it schedules it and may batch multiple updates together for performance.

Because state updates are asynchronous and may be batched. Using a function ensures you're working with the latest state value, especially when doing multiple or sequential updates based on previous state.

```javascript
setCount(count + 1);
setCount(count + 1); // Still uses stale value

// You might expect count to increase by 2, but both calls use the same count value, so it only increments once! ðŸ˜±

setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
setCount((prev) => prev + 1);

// Now React ensures that each update uses the latest state, so the final value is correctly updated to count + 2.

// React batches multiple state updates together to avoid re-rendering multiple times.
```

2. Difference between realDOM and virtualDOM

ðŸ”¸ The Real DOM:
The DOM (Document Object Model) is the browserâ€™s live representation of a web page.
Itâ€™s a complex, tree-like structure with tons of properties, methods, and references.
Updating the real DOM is resource-heavyâ€”every change can trigger layout recalculations and repaints, which slows down performance.
ðŸ”¸ The Virtual DOM:
Reactâ€™s Virtual DOM isnâ€™t a full clone of the real DOM.
Instead, itâ€™s a streamlined JavaScript object tree that contains just the essential information about your UI: element types, attributes, and children.
It doesnâ€™t include browser-specific details, event listeners, or rendering logicâ€”just enough to describe what the UI should be.
