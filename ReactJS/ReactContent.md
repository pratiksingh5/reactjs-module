# ðŸš€ ReactJS Full Course Syllabus (Basic â†’ Advanced)

## **1. Basics of React**
- Introduction to React 
- SPA concept  
- Setting up React project (Vite)  
- Folder structure best practices  
- JSX syntax & expressions  
- Components (Function vs Class â€“ but focus on Function)  
- Props (passing data to components)  
- State (`useState`)  
- Event handling (`onClick`, `onChange`, etc.)  
- Conditional rendering (`if`, `&&`, `?:`)  
- List rendering (`map`, keys in React)  

---

## **2. Styling in React**
- Inline styles & style objects  
- CSS Modules  
- Global CSS & component-level CSS  
- TailwindCSS / SCSS basics  
- Dynamic styling with state  

---

## **3. React Hooks (Core)**
- `useState` (state management)  
- `useEffect` (side effects, lifecycle replacement)  
- `useRef` (DOM refs, mutable values, focus handling)  
- `useContext` (global state without prop drilling)  

---

## **4. React Hooks (Advanced/Useful)**
- `useReducer` (complex state, alternative to Redux)  
- `useCallback` (memoizing functions)  
- `useMemo` (performance optimization)  
- `useLayoutEffect` (sync before paint)  
- `useImperativeHandle` (custom refs)  
- Custom Hooks (reusable logic â€“ debounce, fetch, auth, localStorage, etc.)  

---

## **5. Forms & Input Handling**
- Controlled vs uncontrolled inputs  
- Handling multiple inputs (object state)  (Learn in Project)
- Validation (manual & libraries like Yup)  (Learn in Project)
- Multi-step forms  
- File upload handling  
- Form libraries (Formik, React Hook Form)  (Learn in Project)

---

## **6. Component Patterns**
- Higher-Order Components (HOCs)  
- Render Props pattern  
- Controlled vs uncontrolled components  
- Reusable component design  

---

## **7. State Management (Beyond useState)**
- Context API (with useReducer for global state)  
- Redux (basics â†’ Redux Toolkit)  
- Zustand / Jotai / Recoil (modern alternatives)  

---

## **8. Routing**
- React Router (v6+)
  - Basic routing (BrowserRouter, Routes, Route)  
  - Nested routes  
  - Dynamic routes (`/user/:id`)  
  - Navigation (`useNavigate`)  
  - Protected routes (Auth)  
  - Lazy loading routes  

---

## **9. Data Fetching & API Handling** (Will Learn in Project)
- Fetch API & Axios in React  
- `useEffect` for fetching  
- Handling loading & error states  
- Pagination & infinite scroll  
- Debouncing search queries  

---

## **10. Performance Optimization**
- React.memo for component memoization  
- `useCallback` & `useMemo` use cases  
- Code splitting & lazy loading (`React.lazy`, `Suspense`)  
- Profiler tool in React DevTools  

---

## **11. Advanced React Features**
- Portals (modals, tooltips)  
- Error Boundaries (error handling in UI)  
- Concurrent React (concepts of concurrent rendering)  

---

## **12. Testing in React**
- Unit testing with Jest  
- Component testing with React Testing Library  
- Mocking API calls  
- Snapshot testing  
- End-to-End testing (Cypress / Playwright)  

---

## **13. Build & Deployment**
- Environment variables in React  
- Optimizing build for production  
- CI/CD basics (Netlify)  

---

- Internationalization (i18n)   [Not Included]
- Accessibility (WCAG basics, ARIA roles)  [Will Try to Cover]
- Animations (Framer Motion, React Spring)  [Not Included]
- Charts & visualization (Recharts, Chart.js, D3 basics)  [Will Try to Cover in Quiz App]
- Real-time apps (WebSockets, Socket.io)  [Will Try to Cover in Quiz App]

---
